# delivery contract: every runtime dependency of scripts/day-open-pipeline.sh
# must resolve inside the delivery root (template scripts/ + seed mirror), with
# transitive closure over python imports and shell sources — not just the files
# someone remembered to list. Spec: peer sessions 2026-08-20-42 (5-point fixture
# spec) and 2026-08-21-17 (baseline->promote->green protocol, codex amendments:
# dynamic call sites, +x/shebang, manifest duplicates, extension-graph strict
# xfail until ArchGate Q1).
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible on purpose (macOS /bin/bash): no declare -A, no mapfile.

# Usage: bash setup/test-day-open-delivery-closure.sh
